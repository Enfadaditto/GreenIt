**GreenIt** is the social media platform that allows users to create stories related to environmental care. Each story comprises multiple steps, allowing users to describe the actions they took to achieve their goals.


**GreenIt** was made in the team of Andrea Catalán, Paula Llobregat, Julia Duda, Wojciech Neuman, Pablo Roig, Lluis Terol, José Ramón Bermejo y Héctor Aibar.


Currently, the application's content is not visible due to the end of the AWS free tier.
